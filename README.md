## Heath-Hack

# Inspiration
The methods of the student wellbeing team are basic. We were inspired to create a game that the student health and wellness team can utilize to better connect with students and convey their important message of promoting mental health.

# What it does
**Health-Hack** is a health and wellness platform game that turns the user from manually focusing on self-care to a retro gaming style! Basically, our game is inspired by Cookie Clicker. We developed a **Mario-inspired clicker game**, where players click on coins to earn in-game currency. These coins can be spent on power-ups like:
- **Mushrooms** - Makes Mario grow bigger
- **Fire Flower** - Allows Mario to shoot fireballs
- **And more!**

But the real power-ups come from **real-world actions**! Players can earn stars - a premium in-game currency - by hitting personal health goals, such as:
- Getting enough sleep
- Eating within a healthy calorie range
- Completing daily exercise goals
- And more!

# How we built it
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS for the game website
- **Backend:** JavaScript and Node.js
- **Database:** Local database for login/register credentials, and SQL for storing tables and information

# Challenges we ran into
- Connecting the database to our **VSCode** and making the routing work
- Facing **Git challenges**, ensuring all of our work was saved, and resolving errors with diverging branches

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a great game application and putting our hard work into it over a couple of days. We:
- Learned new things in **programming**
- Successfully created a **personal project**

# What we learned
We gained knowledge of:
- **Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Working in a team on a collective programming project
- How to be **more productive** and collaborative

# What's next for Health-Hack
We plan to **add and integrate more important features**, primarily on the health side, in the near future.

# Important Master Key
**Master Key -** Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`.
We created a login account so that the database wonâ€™t be accessible by everyone, ensuring security while allowing access to the game.
