# Heath-Hack

Inspiration
The methods of student wellbeing team are basic is We were inspired to create a game that the student health and wellness team can utilize to better connect with students and convey their important message of promoting mental heath.

What it does
Health-Hack is an health and wellness platform game that turns the user from manually focusing on self-care to a retro gaming style! Basically, our game is inspired by cookie clicker. We developed a Mario-inspired clicker game, where players click on coins to earn in-game coins. These coins can be spent on power-ups like mushrooms which makes Mario grow bigger, fire flower which allows Mario to shoot fireballs and more. But the real power-ups come from real-world actions! Players can earn stars - a premium in-game currency by hitting personal health goals, such as: getting enough sleep, eating within a healthy calorie range, complete daily exercise goals and more.

How we built it
We used HTML, CSS for the front end of our game website. We also used javascript and Node.js for the backend and used the local database to store login/register credentials and SQL for storing tables and information .

Challenges we ran into
We had some trouble with connecting the database to our VSCode and making the routing work.
We also had some challenges in Git, and making sure all of our work is saved and error with diverging branches.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of making a great game application and putting our hard work into it over a couple of days. We accomplished learning new things in programming and accomplished making a personal project.

What we learned
We learned new concepts and tools in programming, involving Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and how to work in a team working on a collective programming project. We learned how to be more productive.

What's next for Health-Hack
We will add and integrate more important features primarily on the health side in the near future.

Important
Master Key: Master Key - Username: admin, Password: admin. So we created a login account already so the database wonâ€™t be accessible by everyone and you can have an account for the game.
